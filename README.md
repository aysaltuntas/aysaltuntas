Hi! I'm Ayşe Altuntaş. I'm a 10th-grade student at Bheçeşehir Private Anatolian High School in Mersin.
My hobbies include acquiring new experiences, playing basketball, and practicing combat sports, which I'm licensed in. 
I also want to have fun learning software, and I'm aware of the benefits it will bring to my life.
